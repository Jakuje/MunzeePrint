Munzee Print
============

A simple script for printing your munzee QR codes. It is inspired by
similar script on qr.ite.lt but it has several improvements:

 * The configuration is stored in cookies
 * Possibility to use images on background
 * It is Open Source

Where I can try it?

There is my instance running on https://munzee.dta3.com/ . Feel
free to use it to generate your own QR codes.


Can I run it on my own?
-----------------------
Yes, there are just a few things you will need:

 * PHP Interpreter
 * TCPDF library: Can be pulled from https://github.com/tecnickcom/TCPDF
